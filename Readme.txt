1. Check for all the python dependencies and libraries, moreover be sure your XAMPP/WampServer is up and running before executing the source file.

2. Place the "Server Files" folder contents into XAMPP's "htdocs" folder. Or if you are using WampServer then place them into "www" folder.

3. Run the SA.py file from "Python Side" folder, using terminal. (You do not have to run any other file, it would do all the work itself).

NOTE: Check for the files location paths in the source code and change it accordingly.
